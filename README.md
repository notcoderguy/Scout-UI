Tailwind CSS & Alpine JS - Vite Starter Template

We use this as a starter template to quickly develop static mpa HTML pages with :

- TailwindCSS 3.x
- Vite 3.x
- PostCSS
- Alpine JS

To get started, clone the project and install the dependencies:

```text
npm install
```

After that, fire up vite using:

```text
npm run dev
```

To build final build use:

```text
npm run build
```

Base Tailwind CSS file is under `src/resources/css/app.css`  
Root HTML file is under `src/index.html`

After that you will have a ready build to deploy at `/dist`
